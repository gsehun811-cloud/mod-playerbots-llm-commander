/*
 * This file is part of the LLM bots feature of mod-playerbots (AzerothCore).

 * The tools a bot may call to look at the world.
 *
 * Threading: LlmProvider::Complete runs on a worker thread and must never
 * touch game state, so tools are NOT executed there. The provider returns the
 * calls the model asked for, the world thread runs them here against a live
 * Player*, and LlmClient::Resume feeds the results back. Everything in this
 * file is world-thread only.
